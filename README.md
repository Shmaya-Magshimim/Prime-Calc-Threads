Exercise eleven in 'Advanced Programming' course .<br>
In this exercise we'll experiment with parllelism and basic multithread programming.<br>
We will build a program that finds all the prime numbers in a given range, and then test it in multiple situations:
- single threaded
- multi-threaded <br>

The purpose of this exercise is to understand how threads can improve performance and user experience.
